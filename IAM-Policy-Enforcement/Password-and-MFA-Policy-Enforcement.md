# IAM Policy Enforcement Lab – Password and MFA Security

## Environment
Microsoft Entra ID (Cloud IAM)
Cyber Atlanta Active Directory Simulator

## Objective
Enforce credential security policies and identity protection controls.

## Actions Performed

### Password Policy Enforcement (Active Directory Simulation)
- Configured password expiration policy to enforce credential rotation every 30 days
- Applied password policy to all directory users
- Enforced password complexity requirements
- Verified policy application across identity directory

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement
- Verified MFA enrollment readiness for user accounts
- Confirmed authenticator-based authentication availability
- Validated authentication security controls

### Identity Security Validation
- Verified authentication status for user accounts
- Ensured identity access aligned with security policies
- Maintained identity lifecycle security controls

## Security Principles Applied

- Least Privilege Access
- Credential Lifecycle Management
- Authentication Security
- Identity Governance
- Zero Trust Identity Principles

## Outcome

Successfully enforced identity security policies and authentication protections in simulated enterprise IAM environments.

This lab demonstrates practical IAM operational security skills aligned with real-world IAM analyst responsibilities.
