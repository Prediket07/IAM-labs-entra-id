## Lab 8 – Privileged Access (PIM-lite)

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate privileged access controls using Microsoft Entra ID by separating emergency admin access from daily operations and validating role changes with audit evidence.

**Key Activities:**
- Created a Break-Glass admin account for emergency use
- Used least-privilege admin roles for day-to-day IAM operations
- Simulated PIM behavior with temporary role elevation and immediate removal
- Verified role assignment/removal using Entra audit logs

**IAM Principles Demonstrated:**
- Least privilege
- Separation of duties
- Privileged access governance
- Auditability and change tracking
